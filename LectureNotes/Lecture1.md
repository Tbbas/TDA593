# TDA593 - Model Driven Software Development
## Lecture 1 - Introduction

**Usage:**  
Model driven engineering can be used for managing upgrades of complex systems. Like the apt-get system for unix distubutions, robotic systems .

**Objectives**
The objective is to learn how to design syftware systems using software modeling techniques, learn different types of models and gain a critical understanding on the usage and when to use models.

**Changes**
*This years' course is a bit different:*

1. Reduced the focus on domain models
2. Reduced the number of covered diagram types
3. Improvment on the grading criteria.

**Book**
There is no compulsory course book. But *"Applying UML And Patterns"* by Craig Larman is recommended.

**Structure**
1. 8 Lectures
2. 6 Assignments
3. 5 Compulsory supervisions

**Groups**
Groups are randomly generated. Each has a supervisor.

**Examination**
Grade 3: 3 to the group and 3 to the induvidual
Grade 4: at least 4 to the group and at least 4 to the induvidual
Grade 5: 5 to the group and 5 to the induvidual
**Project information, can be found in assignments**

## What is a model?
A model is a simplification of a system built with an intended goal in mind. The model should be able to answer questions in place of the actual system.
 - A model has an intent, for a specific costumer
 - A model is an abstraction
 - It describes a subject which exists or will exist.


We will use model to code transformation.
